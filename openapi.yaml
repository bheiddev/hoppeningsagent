    API for crawling brewery events and beer releases using Instagram Graph API and web scraping.
    
    ## Instagram Integration
    This API uses the official Instagram Graph API for reliable access to business Instagram accounts.
    Only business Instagram accounts can be crawled using the `crawlInstagramGraph` action.
    
    ## Database Schema
    
    The API maps crawled events to the following database tables:
    
    ### events_base table (EXACT SCHEMA):
    - id (uuid, primary key, auto-generated)
    - brewery_id (uuid, foreign key to breweries.id) - REQUIRED
    - title (text) - Event title - REQUIRED
    - event_date (date) - Event date in YYYY-MM-DD format - REQUIRED
    - start_time (time) - Start time in HH:MM format or null
    - end_time (time) - End time in HH:MM format or null
    - cost (decimal) - Event cost or 0 if free
    - is_recurring (boolean) - true for weekly recurring events
    - description (text) - Event description
 
    - featured (boolean) - Always false for crawled events
    - brewery_id2 (uuid, foreign key to breweries.id) - If there are two locations, true for Goat Patch, PeaksNPines, Urban Animal
    - brewery_id3 (uuid, foreign key to breweries.id) - If there are three locations, true for Goat Patch, third location is Pikes Peak Brewing
    - updated_at (timestamp, auto-generated)
    
    ### breweries table:
    - id (uuid, primary key)
    - name (text) - Brewery name
    - address (text) - Brewery address
    
    ### beer_releases_base table (EXACT SCHEMA):
    - id (uuid, primary key, auto-generated)
    - brewery_id (uuid, foreign key to breweries.id) - REQUIRED
    - beer_name (text) - Beer name - REQUIRED
    - Type (text) - Beer type (IPA, Stout, etc.) - Note: capitalized in actual schema
    - release_date (date) - Release date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - description (text) - Beer description
    - ABV (text) - Alcohol by volume percentage - Note: capitalized in actual schema
    - created_at (timestamp, auto-generated)
    
    ## Data Mapping (API Input to Database)
    
    **IMPORTANT**: You must provide data in the EXACT database schema format:
    
    Input fields to Database fields:
    - `brewery_id` (uuid) to `brewery_id` (REQUIRED - MUST fetch from /breweries endpoint, never make up)
    - `title` (string) to `title` (REQUIRED)
    - `event_date` (YYYY-MM-DD) to `event_date` (REQUIRED)
    - `start_time` (HH:MM or null) to `start_time`
    - `end_time` (HH:MM or null) to `end_time`
    - `cost` (number) to `cost` - Use 0 for free events, never null
    - `is_recurring` (boolean) to `is_recurring`
    - `description` (string) to `description`
    - `url` (string) to `url`
    - `featured` (boolean) to `featured` (always false for crawled events)
    
    **DO NOT use**: `venue`, `location`, `date`, `time` - these are legacy fields!
    
    ## Brewery UUID Lookup Requirements
    
    **CRITICAL**: Before inserting any events or beer releases:
    1. ALWAYS call GET /breweries endpoint first
    2. Match the brewery by name AND address to get the correct UUID
    3. NEVER make up or guess UUIDs - always fetch from database
    4. For multi-location breweries, carefully match by address:
       - Urban Animal: Match by address (Tejon vs Star Ranch)
       - Goat Patch: Match by address (Cascade vs Northgate)
       - Peaks N Pines: Match by address (Fountain vs Tutt) - peaksnpinesbrew Instagram may have events for both
    
    ## JSON Format Requirement
    
    ALWAYS propose inserts in JSON format before calling upsert endpoints. Show the complete JSON structure with all required fields.
    
    ## Action Chaining Workflow
    
    **CRITICAL**: When crawling Instagram or websites, automatically chain actions together WITHOUT asking for permission:
    
    1. Crawl the Instagram/website (call crawl-instagram-graph or crawl-events)
    2. IMMEDIATELY call GET /breweries to fetch brewery UUIDs from database
    3. Match extracted events/releases to correct brewery UUIDs using name+address
    4. Automatically propose the JSON structure for upserting
    5. Proceed to upsert if user confirms, or wait for confirmation only at the final upsert step
    
    Do NOT ask for permission between steps 1-4. Only ask before the final upsert action.
    
    ## Brewery Instagram Account Mappings
    
    - urbananimaldt Instagram = Urban Animal on Tejon (521 S Tejon St)
    - urbananimal Instagram = Urban Animal on Star Ranch (3629 Star Ranch Rd)
    - goatpatch Instagram = Goat Patch on Cascade (2727 N Cascade Ave)
    - goatpatchbrewingnorthgate Instagram = Goat Patch Northgate (12245 Voyager Pkwy)
    - peaksnpinesbrew Instagram = Events can be for BOTH locations (Fountain or Tutt - determine from event details)
